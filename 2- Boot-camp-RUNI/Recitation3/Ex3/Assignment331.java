// Perfect number is a positive number
// that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors
// (i.e., the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself). 
// For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, 
// which means that 28 is a perfect number. 
// The sum of the proper divisors of 24, however, 
// would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36, which means that 24 is not a perfect number.
// Write a Java program that prints to the screen all the perfect numbers under 1000.
// The method should receive as input a number and return a boolean stating 
// whether the number is a perfect number.
