Control Flow For loops, nested for loops
<!-- Assignment 1
Use a for loop to print the values 1 to n. Note: you should set n to be a number of your choice. (Clarification, n should be set in main, rather than be given as a command-line argument.) 
For example, for n=5
1
2
3
4
5 -->


<!-- Assignment 2
Use a for loop to draw a square in which every line is made of the line number. In particular, given an input n, the output should be an n x n square in the form described below. 
(Clarification, n should be set in main, rather than be given as a command-line argument.) 
For example, for n = 5, the following will be outputted to the screen: 
	1 1 1 1 1 
	2 2 2 2 2
	3 3 3 3 3
	4 4 4 4 4 
	5 5 5 5 5 -->


<!-- Assignment 3
Use a for loop to draw a triangle made of the column index.
In particular, given an input n, the output should be a right triangle in the form described below. 
(Clarification, n should be set in main, rather than be given as a command-line argument.) 

For example, for n=5, the program prints to the screen:
	1
	1 2
	1 2 3
	1 2 3 4 
	1 2 3 4 5 
 -->

<!-- Assignment 4 -->
<!-- Use a for loop to draw an upside-down right triangle made of the column index.
(Clarification, n should be set in main, rather than be given as a command-line argument.) 

For example, for n=5, the program prints to the screen: 
	1 2 3 4 5 
	1 2 3 4
	1 2 3 
	1 2 
	1 -->


<!-- Assignment 5 -->
Given an integer n, use a for loop to draw a right-aligned triangle made of asterisks.
(Clarification, n should be set in main, rather than be given as a command-line argument.) 

For n = 5, the program should print the following to the screen: 
	     *
	    **
	   ***
	  ****
	 *****


<!-- Assignment 6 (BONUS) -->
Use a for loop to draw the following shape:

	54321 12345
	4321     1234
	321         123
	21             12
	1                 1
