<!-- Assignment 3 -->
A prime number (מספר ראשוני) is a number greater than 1 whose only whole-number factors are 1 and itself. For example, 5 is prime because it only divides in 5 and 1.
Write a function that receives as input an integer number, 
and returns true if the number is prime and false otherwise.
Then, using the previous function, write a program that prints all the prime numbers between 2 and an integer number (which is given as a command line argument).
Example output:
