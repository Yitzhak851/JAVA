// Write a Java program that prints the number of words 
// in a given string passed as a command-line argument. 
// The counting of words should be done in a separate method 
// which receives as input a String 
// and outputs an integer representing the number of words in the given string. 

// Hint: Use [str.charAt(i) == ‘ ‘] to check if the character at the ith index in the string str is a space. 
// Note: Assume that the last word is not followed by a space. 

// Example:
// >> java Assignment5 “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”
// Number of words in the string: 9

public class Assignment324 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //get arge[index] from the user
        //set the " " not counting
        //create method that counting the num from " " to " "
        //call method the print the num of words
    }
}
