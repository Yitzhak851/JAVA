Arrays
<!-- Assignment 1 -->
<!-- Write a function getDigits that receives a number as input and returns an array of its digits in the correct
order, from ones to tens to hundreds, etc.
For example: getDigits(754368) returns [8,6,3,4,5,7].
Note: index 0 is for the right most digit.
Write a function isPalindrome that receives an array of integers of any size and returns true if it is a
palindrome and false otherwise.
Reminder: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward and forward.
For example 1221, 173371, 89298 are all palindrome, but the number 1213 is not a palindrome.
Write a main function that receives as input a 6-digit number as a command-line argument and prints
true if it is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
For example, for the input "156445", the method prints false.
Bonus: write the main function in one line! -->

of cards: all numbers 2 â€“ 10, "Jack", "Queen", "King", and "Ace"
