// <!-- Step 1:  -->
// Write a function that receives grid dimensions and a probability, 
// and returns a 2d-array of ints with -1 for every mine, and 0 for every non-mine.

// <!-- Step 2:  -->
// Write a function that receives a grid of mines, changes every 0 to the
// number of adjacent mines, and returns it.

// <!-- Step 3:  -->
// Write a function that receives a coordinate, and returns the value in
