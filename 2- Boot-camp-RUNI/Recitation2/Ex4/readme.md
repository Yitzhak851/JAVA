<!-- Control-Flow
While loops -->
<!-- Exercise 1
Write a Java program that produces this sequence of numbers using a while loop:
8
11
14
17
20
23 -->
 
<!-- Exercise 2 -->
<!-- Write a Java program that prints 1 through n in square brackets. Your program must receive ‘n’ as an argument.
For example, if n = 6, print: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] -->

<!-- Exercise 3 -->
<!-- Write a Java program that prints 1 through n in square brackets. Your program must receive ‘n’ as an argument.
For example, if n = 6, print [6] [5] [4] [3] [2] [1] -->

<!-- Exercise 4 -->
<!-- Write a Java program that computes the sum of all the numbers between min and max and prints them to the screen.
For example, if min = 3 and max = 5, print 12 (because 3 + 4 + 5 = 12).
Note:
1.	Your program must receive ‘min’ and ‘max’ as an argument,
2.	You may assume that both ‘min’ and ‘max’ are positive,
3.	You may assume that ‘max’ is larger than ‘min’. -->

<!-- Exercise 5 -->
Write a Java program that produces all numbers divisible by 3 in the range of min - max using a while loop. Your program must receive ‘min’ and ‘max’ as an argument,

<!-- Exercise 6 -->
Write a Java program that prints all the odd numbers up to n and the sum of them:
Example: n = 9, prints:
1 3 5 7 9
Sum = 25
You must use a do-while loop!
