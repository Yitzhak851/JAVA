<!-- Assignment 1 -->
<!-- Write a program that generates 2 random integers within a defined range [n, m] where n ≠ m.
For simplicity, assume 1 ≤ $ < & ≤ 9.
For example, for n = 3, m = 8, the random integer can be one of {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
Write a method called randomWithRange(…). The method receives two arguments, the min and
max values of the range, and returns a random number within that range (i.e., between [n, m]).
Note: You can use Math.random(), which returns a double in the range of 0.0 and 1.0. -->

<!-- Assignment 2 -->
Write a program that emulates two random dice rolls. 
The program should print the results in the
following form:
where X and Y should both be random numbers in the range of 1-6 where X should be bigger
than Y.
Restriction: use a function from the Math library to determine which of the two numbers is X.
In case the roll dices are the same, additionally print: “Double Up!”

<!-- Assignment 3 -->
Write a Java program to calculate the distance between any two points on a plane. The points
are passed as command line arguments as shown in the example below.
Hint: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.
Note: You may use Math.pow.
Example Output:
First roll scored: X!
Second roll scored: Y!
First roll scored: 5!
Second roll scored: 2!
